## Exercise 1.2; Loops

In this exercise we will use some loops in Python. You already learned how loops work with the PHP Lessons, so this should not be too hard. In python loops are very similar, the main difference is that they are declared differently. In the examples folder you will find some useful examples on how the loops in python work.

The first assignment is to print this;

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
```

Just like in PHP, you can also use loops in loops.

The next assignment is to print this;

```
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 
11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 
12 22 32 42 52 62 72 82 
```

You can also loop through arrays, an array is a list of variables.

The last assignment is to loop through the given array;

```python
countries = ["Netherlands", "Denmark", "Germany", "Belgium", "France", "Sweden"]
```

first try to print every country in this array in order(from left to right). The output will be;

```
Netherlands Denmark Germany Belgium France Sweden 
```

now try to print every country in reverse order(from right to left). The output will be;

```
 Sweden France Belgium Germany Denmark Netherlands
```
