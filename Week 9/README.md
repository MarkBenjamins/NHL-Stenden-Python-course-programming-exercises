# :video_camera: Demonstrating your code

This is the last week of the module and in this week you will demonstrate your code. All of the groups will upload their code to the drone and the drone will preform the end assignments. 

## :hammer:Rules

- For each assignment you get 3 tries to perform the exercise.
- The lowest time counts. 
- Every 30 minutes the groups will switch to a different assignment.
- You can only perform the exercise after giving permission by the assigned instructor for that assignment.

## :trophy:Ending

Every group should have tried every assignment. Based on the lowest times, scores will be calculated for every group. When all the scores are known, the score's will be collected and a winner will be elected.
