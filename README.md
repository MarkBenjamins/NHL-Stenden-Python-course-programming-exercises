# NHL-Stenden-Python-course-programming-exercises
This file will contain all of the exercises for this module. 
It also contains examples for each week that will help you with new or complicated functions. 
For extra difficult actions, like setting up Python or using the simulator, we have provided manuals in the [manuals]() folder. 
The exercises will be ordered by week and they each have their own folder, and the relevant examples will also be provided in the same "week folder".
