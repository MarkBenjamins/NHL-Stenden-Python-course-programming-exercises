# :school: NHL-Stenden-Python-course-programming-exercises
This repository will contain all of the exercises for this module. 
It also contains examples for each week that will help you with new or complicated functions. 
There are manuals provided for the difficult tasks, like using the simulator or the drone. These manuals are located within the manuals folder of the specific week.
The exercises will be ordered by week and they each have their own folder, and the relevant examples will also be provided in the same "week folder".

## :closed_book: Course Python the first flight
In this module the students learn the fundamentals from Python. 
Using the assignments that get more difficult as the period advances, the students learn to write simple Python programs. 
The students will also learn to use GitHub for version control, because all of the assignments and examples are available through GitHub, and the drone assignments also have to be executed through GitHub. 
The final assignment will also teach the students the basics of AI and the Student will explore the possibilities that it offers.
